html-webpack-plugin

    The HtmlWebpackPlugin simplifies creation of HTML 
    files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful 
    for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes
     every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you,
    supply your own template using lodash templates, or use your own loader.

Installation
    npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin

Basic Usage
    const path = require('path');
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = {
    entry: './src/js/index.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'js/bundle.js'
    },
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist'
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        filename: 'index.html',
        template: './src/index.html'
        })
    ]
    };
