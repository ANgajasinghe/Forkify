# Forkify
The Forkify Recipe App allows users to search for recipes using the Food2Fork API. Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need. At this point the user can favorite the recipe or even add it to their shopping list if they want to shop for more than one recipe. Favorite meals are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application. Technologies Used: 
- HTML5 & CSS3 The layout was carefully designed using CSS3 BEM naming convention. CSS-Grid was used to comply with the newest standards of development. 
- JavaScript No frameworks were used in the development of this application. All functionality was built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript so feel free to dive into the code.
- Webpack Webpack was used as the module bundler to incorporate Axios for fetching as well as BABEL for compiling the next-gen JavaScript.
